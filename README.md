# SampleWebScrapingApp
Sample webscraper takes a list of links from a CSV.
Makes requests with urllib.
Converts them from HTML to text and saves all the texts to a new CSV file.
It essentially turns a list of links on a CSV into a list of the texts for the links in the CSV.
You may add some sort of text cleaning or editing to suit your functionality.
